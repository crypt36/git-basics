# Modular No-Code Portfolio Template
This project is set up for teaching beginners. Students should mostly edit one file: `src/content/portfolio.config.ts`.

## Student Workflow (Edit Only Here)
1. Open `src/content/portfolio.config.ts`.
2. Update text, links, and images.
3. Reorder or remove sections by editing the `blocks` array.
4. Keep each block `id` and `type` stable.
5. Save and refresh the app.

If the app shows a config error table, fix the listed field path in `portfolio.config.ts`.

## Block Catalog
- `hero`: Intro heading, CTAs, hero image
- `about`: Profile image, paragraphs, stat cards
- `skills`: Skill list with progress bars
- `services`: Service cards (icon, title, description)
- `experience`: Timeline entries
- `contact`: Contact details + contact form
- `footer`: Social links + copyright

## Contact Form (Google SMTP)
The contact form posts to `POST /api/contact`.

Set environment variables before running:
- `SMTP_HOST`
- `SMTP_PORT`
- `SMTP_USER`
- `SMTP_PASS`
- `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL`

You can start by copying `.env.example` into your local `.env`.

Recommended Gmail setup:
- Use `smtp.gmail.com`
- Use port `465` (SSL) or `587` (TLS)
- Use a Gmail App Password, not your normal account password

## Troubleshooting
| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Config error panel appears | Schema validation failed | Correct the field shown in the error table |
| Contact form returns error | Missing/invalid SMTP env vars | Set all required SMTP variables |
| Contact form sends but no email received | `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` is incorrect or filtered | Verify destination inbox and spam folder |
| Too many requests error | Rate limiter triggered | Wait 10 minutes and retry |
| A section is missing | Block removed from `blocks` array | Add the block back with a valid `type` |
